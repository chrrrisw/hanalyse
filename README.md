hanalyse
========

A tool to help with binary file analysis.

The plan (current implmentation is minimally functional) is to have a tool
that allows you to store metadata describing the format of binary files, and
to display the file so annotated.

Please see the Wiki for screenshots on the [Worked Example](https://github.com/chrrrisw/hanalyse/wiki/Worked-Example) page.

You'll need [QHexEdit](https://github.com/chrrrisw/QHexEdit) from my repo to
provide the python bindings for the QHexEdit widget that's used.
